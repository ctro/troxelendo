    <h2>Philosophy</h2>
    <p>
      My practice philosophy is very simple — <strong>Do the Right Thing.</strong>
      That first means to treat patients as human beings rather than transactional commodities.
      It means to give each patient the time and attention they deserve, in order to carefully explain their problem and
      the means by which we can resolve it.
      It means to give each treatment the proper amount of clinical time and appointments it deserves, thereby
      maximizing quality, prognosis, and outcome.
      It means to give back to the community that has given so much to you.

    <h2>Education</h2>
    <p>
      Dr. Troxel completed his undergraduate studies at DePauw University, graduating Summa Cum Laude.
      He continued his dental education at Indiana University School of Dentistry and was awarded his Doctor of Dental
      Surgery Degree as class valedictorian.
      Following dental school, Dr. Troxel completed a General Practice Residency, which focused on comprehensive care,
      surgery, and anesthesia.
      He finished his education at Indiana University Graduate Endodontics, where he earned his Master’s of Science in
      Dentistry as well as his Certificate in Endodontics.

    <h2>Technology</h2>
    <h4>Microscope</h4>
    <p>
      Dr. Troxel utilizes a microscope to perform all root canals and surgical procedures under high magnification.
      The microscope illuminates and magnifies an otherwise dark and minute area.
      The canals of your teeth can be as narrow as a strand of hair, and without the aid of a microscope can be easily
      missed.
    </p>
    <h4>CBCT</h4>
    <p>
      Dr. Troxel is trained on advanced radiography, including dental CT scans.
      These scans offer a three dimensional view of a tooth, and allows Dr. Troxel to identify unusual anatomy, missed
      canals, cracked teeth, and hidden infections.
    </p>
    <h4>Digital X-rays</h4>
    <p>
      In addition to CBCT’s, Dr. Troxel also utilizes digital two-dimensional x-rays.
      Digital x-rays allow lower exposure to patients, while yielding a higher resolution product.
      They are used before, during, and after treatment to confirm progress and quality.
    </p>
    <h4>Ultrasonics</h4>
    <p>
      The ultrasonic is an acoustic instrument, which allows Dr. Troxel to conservatively access difficult areas of your
      tooth.
      These instruments are used to treat calcified canals, remove broken instruments, locate extra canals, and remove
      posts.
    </p>
    <h4>EndoActivator</h4>
    <p>
      The EndoActivator uses polymer tips and sonic energy to agitate the antibacterial irrigants used during treatment.
      Activated fluids promote deep cleaning into hard-to-reach canal anatomy.
      Inadequate cleaning of these spaces can lead to re-infection.
      Evidence suggests that the use of the device and its disinfecting capabilities promotes the long-term success of
      root canal therapy.

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
      Dr. Troxel was raised in northeastern Indiana by a crop farmer and a tap dance teacher.
      Although his education and interests have taken him far from home, he does his best to retain the midwestern
      decency and humility with which he grew up.
      Endodontics has been a rewarding career that compels honesty and trust between patient and provider—these
      relationships are what motivate Dr. Troxel daily.
      Dr. Troxel is married to his beautiful wife Joy, who is also a practicing dentist in Steamboat Springs.
      Outside of the office, Dr. Troxel enjoys cooking, music production, skiing, paddling, fly-fishing, and spoiling
      his dog Olive.
