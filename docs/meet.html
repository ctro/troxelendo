    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
      Dr. Troxel was raised in northeastern Indiana by a farmer and a tap dance teacher.
      Although his education and interests have taken him far from home, he does his best to retain the midwestern
      decency and humility with which he grew up.
      Endodontics has been a rewarding career that compels honesty and trust between patient and provider—these
      relationships are what motivate Dr. Troxel daily.
      Dr. Troxel is married to his beautiful wife Joy, who is also a practicing dentist in Steamboat Springs.
      Outside of the office, Dr. Troxel enjoys paddling, telemark skiing, camping, cooking, fly-fishing, and spoiling
      his dog Olive.
