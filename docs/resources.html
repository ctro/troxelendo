    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <h4>Before Treatment</h4>
    <p>
      Please continue to take all medications as prescribed by your physician.
      Be sure to eat a normal meal before your appointment.
      As instructed by your physician, take any prescribed dental antibiotic prophylaxis for mitral valve prolapse,
      heart murmur, joint prosthesis, cardiac prosthesis, or rheumatic heart disease.
      If necessary, three tablets (600mg) of Ibuprofen (Advil) will help to diminish any inflammation.
    </p>
    <h4>After Treatment</h4>
    <p>
      Your tooth and surrounding gum tissue will likely be tender for several days as a result of treatment and the
      previous condition of your tooth.
      This tenderness is normal and is not cause for alarm.
      Any discomfort is best alleviated by taking ibuprofen (Advil) as directed.
      When your endodontic therapy is completed, a temporary protective restoration will be placed to seal the root
      canal.
      You must see your general dentist within six weeks to get your permanent restoration (crown or filling).
      Failure to do so may compromise your root canal and require further treatment or removal of the tooth.
